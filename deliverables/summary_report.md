**Security Summary Report**

---

**Overview**
This report details the security evaluation and remediation performed on a vulnerable containerized Flask application. The project involved reviewing insecure source code and configuration files (`app.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml`) and implementing industry-aligned best practices to secure the entire application stack. The goals were to identify vulnerabilities, apply secure defaults, and enhance the deployment architecture to reflect modern DevSecOps principles.

---

**Steps Taken**

1. **Code Remediation**

   * Eliminated hardcoded passwords by using `.env` files and `python-dotenv`.
   * Replaced unsafe use of `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval` to prevent remote code execution.
   * Implemented input validation using regular expressions and type checks.
   * Restricted Flask application to bind only to `localhost`, reducing attack surface.

2. **Docker Hardening**

   * Switched to a minimal base image (`python:3.11-slim`) to reduce the image size and vulnerability exposure.
   * Created a non-root user and set it as the default with `USER appuser`.
   * Added a `HEALTHCHECK` directive to improve container observability.
   * Noted the potential for implementing multi-stage builds to further harden and optimize the container image.

3. **docker-compose.yml Enhancements**

   * Restricted container permissions using `read_only: true` and `security_opt: no-new-privileges`.
   * Set `mem_limit` and `pids_limit` to enforce resource constraints.
   * Limited network exposure by binding the service port to `127.0.0.1`.
   * Consolidated secrets management through environment variables using a `.env` file.

**Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed**

| Vulnerability                                             | Resolution                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hardcoded secrets in `app.py`                             | Moved credentials to `.env` file                             |
| Use of `eval()`                                           | Replaced with `ast.literal_eval`                             |
| Lack of input validation                                  | Added strict validation logic                                |
| Flask server bound to all interfaces                      | Restricted to `127.0.0.1`                                    |
| Dockerfile used root user                                 | Added non-root user and switched context                     |
| No health monitoring                                      | Introduced Docker `HEALTHCHECK`                              |
| docker-compose.yml lacked resource and privilege controls | Added `read_only`, memory and PID limits, and `security_opt` |

**Architecture and Security Improvements**
The revised architecture promotes layered security through:

* **Secure Code Practices:** Sanitized inputs and safe parsing functions help prevent injection and logic vulnerabilities.
* **Container Security:** Minimal images and non-root containers reduce exposure and privilege escalation risk.
* **Deployment Safety:** The use of `.env` files and local-only bindings mitigate data leaks and unauthorized access.
* **Operational Resilience:** Health checks, resource limits, and principle of least privilege enhance runtime reliability and fault isolation.

These changes collectively reduce the attack surface, improve runtime control, and support scalable security.

**Reflection on Lessons Learned**

This project reinforced several key takeaways:

* **Security must be integrated early.** Insecure design decisions, like hardcoded secrets or eval-based logic, are much easier to fix in development than in production.
* **Containers demand explicit hardening.** Defaults often prioritize convenience over security. Thoughtful configuration is essential.
* **Layered defenses are necessary.** By addressing application, container, and infrastructure risks simultaneously, overall security posture improves significantly.
* **Automation and standards matter.** Leveraging `.env` files, Docker health checks, and minimal images makes security reproducible and maintainable.

This assignment provided hands-on experience bridging secure development, container security, and infrastructure resilience.

**Conclusion**
By systematically evaluating and remediating the insecure starting environment, the project transformed a vulnerable proof-of-concept into a hardened, containerized application aligned with best practices. The final state reflects secure defaults, operational observability, and a foundation ready for future security integrations.
