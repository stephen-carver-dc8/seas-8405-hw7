    - Hardcoded secrets in PASSWORD variable. Never used. But still there.
    - Command injectoin with ping. Shell=true is bad practice. The IP in put is not validated.
    - Calculate has an unsafe use of eval() that can lead to remote code execution and should use literal_eval or alternative.
    - Flask is running with unsafe defaults. The app should be limited to local host during development or behind a reverse proxy.

make check

This does not work as written. It only runs the first command. For now we will evaluate its output.

We will now manually run the second command and evaluate its output.

make scan

make host-security

These tools are not perfect. Notice it is warning about this file having incorrect ownership, when infact the ownership matches its expectations.
